      Me and my younger child, Christmas 2023.
    </span>
    <span class="newthought">I grew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia</span>,
    and attended <a href="https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/physics.html">Dalhouse University</a>.  For my undergraduate research I worked in the <a href="http://pierce.atmos.colostate.edu/">Aerosol and Cloud Group</a> on the link between cosmic ray flux and cloud formation, and improving modelling of sea-salt aerosol production.  After completing my BSc I moved into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140910113614/http://quantum.phys.dal.ca/members/jordan/index.html">Quantum Theory Group</a> and worked on translating classical problems of interest (mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem#3-satisfiability">3-SAT</a>) onto Quantum computers, culminating in my thesis <a href="https://github.com/esnowkropla/eskthesis">Compiling Programs for an Adiabatic Quantum Computer</a>.

  <p>In addition to various stints as a software developer, from 2015-2017 I was the co-founder and lead programmer at Two and Thirty Software working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/405240/Hairy_Little_Buggers/">Hairy Little Buggers</a>. From 2017-2018 I was the technical lead at the <a href="https://media.klick.com/">Klick Media</a> Data Science team. Currently, I work as a Senior Software Developer at <a href="https://www.humi.ca">Humi</a>.</p>
